## ReactJS: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
### React Web Page Example

This is a simple example of a React web page that includes various HTML elements 
and is styled using CSS. The project demonstrates how to create a basic web page using ReactJS with the assistance of CDN links.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the React web page.

## Code Explanation

In this project, we've created a React web page with the following structure:

- An `<h1>` tag for the page title.
- Four `<div>` elements, each with different child elements:
  1. The first `<div>` contains a single `<p>` tag.
  2. The second `<div>` contains a `<p>` tag and an `<a>` (anchor) tag.
  3. The third `<div>` contains a single `<p>` tag.
  4. The fourth `<div>` contains a single `<p>` tag.

We use `React.createElement` to create these elements and `ReactDOM.render` to render them into the HTML document.

## CSS Styling

The project includes a separate CSS file (`styles.css`) for styling the HTML elements. The CSS styles applied to the elements are as follows:

- `.app-container` styles are applied to the main container for the entire application.
- `.content-container` styles are applied to the div elements that contain content.
- Styles for the anchor (`<a>`) tag are also provided, including normal and hover states.
